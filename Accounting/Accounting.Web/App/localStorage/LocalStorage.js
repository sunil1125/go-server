Description: Stores the data in this object for the opened tabs, so that no need
to get the data from the database again, In case of multi user there
there this will throe an exception record already changed, there is
only a problem is that user will not get the latest data if any
thing is changed, and memory point of view we have seen that there
will be only 10 tab at a time do we have biggest is SalesOrder object.
